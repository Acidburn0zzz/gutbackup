oldtime, The old time.

### Is It Good?

Yes.

### Is It "Production Readyâ„¢"?

No.

Getting Started
--------------

For example, we want to backup /oldtime to /tmp/hello.oldtime using rsync.

create hello example

	$ git clone git://github.com/GutenYe/oldtime-hello-example.git  /tmp/oldtime
	$ sudo ln -s /tmp/oldtime /oldtime

it will have these files:

	# /oldtime/oldtimerc
		media = "/tmp"  # get this variable by Rc.media. Syntax see Optimsim

	/oldtime/oldtime/
		hello.conf
		hello/
			backup.hello

	# /oldtime/oldtime/hello/backup.hello

		/oldtime/  <%=Rc.media%>/hello.oldtime/ # an ERB template. see ERB

		[exclude]
		/.git
    /oldtimerc

	# /oldtime/hello.conf

		require "oldtime/rsync"
		
		configure <<EOF
			backup:
				rsync.options = "-av --delete" # get this variable by Rc.backup.rsync.options
			
			restore:
				rsync.options = "-av"
		EOF

		backup do
			rsync2 "backup.hello"  # load /oldtime/hello/backup.hello file
		end

		restore do
			rsync "<%=Rc.media%>/hello.oldtime/ /oldtime/.oldtime/"
		end

Let's begin.

	$ oldtime backup hello
	# it calls "rsync -av --delete --exclude-from /tmp/hello.xxx/exclude /oldtime/ /tmp/hello.oldtime/"

	$ oldtime restore hello
	# it calls "rsync -av /tmp/hello.oldtime/ /oldtime/"

for a real world example, see [oldtime-archlinux-solution](https://github.com/GutenYe/oldtime-archlinux-solution).

Install
-------

	# Archlinux
	pacman -S ruby rsync
	gem install oldtime

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
6. Coding Style Guide: https://gist.github.com/1105334
